## Acknowledgments

This Go implementation is a high-performance reimplementation of the original Python-based Interactive Feedback MCP created by FÃ¡bio Ferreira. We extend our sincere gratitude to FÃ¡bio for his innovative work on the original project, which has inspired this Go version. The original Python implementation can be found at [https://github.com/noopstudios/interactive-feedback-mcp](https://github.com/noopstudios/interactive-feedback-mcp).

This Go version maintains full compatibility with the original MCP protocol while providing significant performance improvements and additional features for enhanced user experience.

Simple [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to enable a human-in-the-loop workflow in AI-assisted development tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com). This Go implementation provides the same functionality as the original Python version but with dramatically better performance and additional features.

     }
   }
   ```

### ðŸ”§ Development Installation

**For developers who want to build from source:**

#### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Python 3.x (for desktop GUI)
- Git

#### Build from source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/interactive-feedback-mcp-go.git
cd interactive-feedback-mcp-go

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the MCP server
go build -o mcp-server-single cmd/mcp-server-single/main.go

# Make it executable
chmod +x mcp-server-single
```

#### Cross-platform builds
```bash
# Use the build script for all platforms
./scripts/build.sh

# Or build manually for specific platforms
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mcp-server-single.exe cmd/mcp-server-single/main.go
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mcp-server-single-linux cmd/mcp-server-single/main.go
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o mcp-server-single-macos cmd/mcp-server-single/main.go
```

#### Create packages
```bash
# Create .zip and .tar.gz packages for distribution
./scripts/build-packages.sh
```

## Configuration

### Cursor MCP Configuration

Add the following to your Cursor MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "interactive-feedback": {
      "command": "/path/to/interactive-feedback-mcp-go/mcp-server-single",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Project Configuration

The MCP server automatically creates `.interactive-feedback-config.json` in your project directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "run_command": "",
  "execute_automatically": false,
  "command_section_visible": true,
  "conversation_history": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-19T01:00:00Z",
      "role": "user|assistant",
      "content": "Message content",
      "is_current": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Auto .gitignore Management

The MCP server automatically adds `.interactive-feedback-config.json` to your project's `.gitignore` file to prevent config files from being committed to version control.

## Usage

### Running the MCP Server

```bash
# Run the MCP server
./mcp-server-single

# The server will listen for JSON-RPC requests on stdin
```

### MCP Tool Definition

The server provides the following tool:

**Tool Name**: `interactive_feedback`

**Description**: Get interactive feedback from user for development tasks

**Parameters**:
- `projectDirectory` (string, required): The project directory path
- `prompt` (string, required): The prompt to show to the user
- `previousUserRequest` (string, required): The previous user request that triggered this interactive feedback

**Example Usage**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "interactive_feedback",
    "arguments": {
      "projectDirectory": "/path/to/project",
      "prompt": "Please provide your feedback on this implementation",
      "previousUserRequest": "User requested help with implementing a feature"
    }
  }
}
```

### Desktop GUI

When the MCP server is called, it automatically launches a desktop GUI with:

1. **Conversation History Display**: Shows previous user requests and assistant prompts
2. **Copy Conversation Button**: Copies conversation history in markdown format
3. **Feedback Input**: Text area for user to provide feedback
4. **Submit/Cancel Buttons**: Submit feedback or cancel without feedback

### Conversation History

The system maintains conversation history with the following features:

- **Automatic Trimming**: Keeps only the last 10 conversation entries
- **Rich Text Support**: Handles markdown, emoji, and special characters
- **Markdown Copy**: Copy conversation in formatted markdown
- **Empty Feedback Support**: Users can skip feedback without errors

## Prompt Engineering

For the best results, add the following to your custom prompt in your AI assistant:

> Whenever you want to ask a question, always call the MCP `interactive_feedback`.  
> Whenever you're about to complete a user request, call the MCP `interactive_feedback` instead of simply ending the process.  
> Keep calling MCP until the user's feedback is empty, then end the request.

This will ensure your AI assistant uses this MCP server to request user feedback before marking the task as completed.

## Why Use This?

By guiding the assistant to check in with the user instead of branching out into speculative, high-cost tool calls, this module can drastically reduce the number of premium requests (e.g., OpenAI tool invocations) on platforms like Cursor. In some cases, it helps consolidate what would be up to 25 tool calls into a single, feedback-aware request â€” saving resources and improving performance.
